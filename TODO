Strategies:
- Defend borders evenly
- Cross borders differently
- Blocking strategies, capture one after other
- WorldDominiation fallback, just capture everything
- Attack with all armies if there are no other enemy armies surounding this region
  - Maybe move the attack region logic to a seperate function, general for all

- Eval and modify strategies
